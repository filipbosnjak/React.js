    	    React Hooks

React Hooks let us use state and other React features without writing a class.
So we can use state for eg. in a functional component

We cant: -> use hooks with class components
         -> use hooks inside loops, conditions or nested functions

We have to import them like:
    import React, { useState }  from 'react'; -> We import it with object destructuring

useState - replacement for class-based state

this hook is plenty useful when working with forms
