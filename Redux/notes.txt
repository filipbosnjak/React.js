Redux - state management system (Udemy - Max)

Redux is a pattern and LIBRARY for managing and updating application state 
For that we use events called actions

Redux provides us with global state and lets us update it

Component - event - dispatch - action - reducer updates the store (global state) based of the action - all the subscribed components are updated

npm install redux react-redux

Store in index.js - we are letting react know that the whole app will be using that store

We then connect store with our rootReducer function

In a rootReducer we combine all the other reducers - import combineReducers from redux and import all the reducers we want to combine and then:

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  todosReducer,
  filterReducer,
});

Each reducer takes a state and an action. Based on the content of the action object it updates the state in a store
