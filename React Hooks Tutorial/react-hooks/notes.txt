const [] = useReducer(reducer , {count : 0})

useReducer - hook for managing state 
takes in reducer - a function that updates the state and
         initial state - 

Kinda like useState hook

const [state , dispatch]

dispatch - makes a call to a reducer function based on which reducer we want to use

- reducer function - takes in state and action - 
    action has types that tells reducer what to do given a certain type


after reducers and state is initialized -

first dispatch is called and it takes action and payload - 

dispatch() comunicates with reducer and sends it actions object with type and payload

reducer based on a given action performs operations requested on a state
