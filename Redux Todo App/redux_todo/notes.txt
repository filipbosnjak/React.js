We have our components and some of them triggers an event. 
That triggers a dispatch() function that sends object {type:... ,payload:...}
This is the info that we need to update the state

In actions folder we have index.js with some actions like:

const someAction = (args) => {
    return {
        type: 'WHAT_WE_WANT_TO_DO',
        payload: {
            what else the : action needs
        }
    }
}

In reducers folder we create our reducers.
Reducers are functions that we give an action object and our state and
based on action.type the update the state. They use payload content if needed

We combine all the reducers in index.js of reducers folder like This

import { combineReducers } from 'redux'
import todosReducer from './todos-reducer'
import filterReducer from './filter-reducer'

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  todosReducer,
  filterReducer
})

export default rootReducer
