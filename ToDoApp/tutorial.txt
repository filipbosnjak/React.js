First step when starting any project is always:
npm init -y 
This creates package.json. This file holds all the info about our project: name, version, packages installed etc.

Then we go and type npx create-react-app app-name

This will get us everything we need to work on our react app

-> index.js - entry point to our app
-> In there we have .render() method where we specify where we want to render our app
-> We render it in <div class <div id="root"></div>
-> We insert all our react components inside that div
